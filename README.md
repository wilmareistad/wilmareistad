## About me

My name is **Wilma Reistad** 
I'm a web development student at Yrgo in Gothenburg, currently looking for LIA. 
I’m a driven and curious developer who enjoys understanding how systems connect from user interfaces to backend logic and databases. I’m motivated by continuous learning and improving my skills in real development environments.
I like to work in teams where knowledge is shered, but I’m also comfortable working independently and taking responsibility for my own tasks.

### Languages & Databases I've Used in Projects
