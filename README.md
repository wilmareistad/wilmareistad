## About me

My name is **Wilma Reistad** 
I'm a web development student at Yrgo in Gothenburg, currently looking for LIA. 
I’m a driven and curious developer who enjoys understanding how systems connect from user interfaces to backend logic and databases. I’m motivated by continuous learning and improving my skills in real development environments.
I thrive in collaborative team settings where knowledge is shared, but I’m comfortable working independently and taking responsibility for my own tasks. I’m quick to learn and structured in my work.

- Node
- C#

### Languages & Databases I've Used in Projects
